# Weather App

We have done a simply weather app for practis working in branches and with API. 
The app should:
-fetch data from the API
-the data should be presented in the specified format, we chose design-2
-the page should be responsive, deigned for mobile, responsive for tablet and desktop

## The problem

We tried to devide the work between us for one api branch and one styling branch. Due to different personal workin hours it was natural for the API branch to finished first. Despite diffrent working hours we were able to help each other and solve diffrent problems along the way.

If we had more time we would do a map funtion for the forecast and add something cool like icons for sunrise and sunset, and make Icons to be animated.
